How to build "ANAGRAM" graph (aka Chain, or a Collection)?

Unlike SWAP implementation, ANAGRAM graph will be linear.

All words containing the same set of consonants are grouped together

So, all four letter words containing the consoants M, N will be in one collection (This can be viewed as a linear chain).

MOON 
MOAN
NOOM
NOAM
NUIM
MIUN
MNUI


To simply your implementation, you can go with a Hash Map of ("String" "ArrayList").

[1] Query the database for words of certain length (say length = 4)
[2] Create multile array lists for each set of Anagrams.
[3] Keep these ArrayLists in a HashMap where key is string of "consonants" and the value is the "ArrayList".

So, your final structure is going to look like this

MN (String, key) ==>  MOON, MOAN, NOOM, NOAM, NUIM, MIUM, MNUI  (ArrayList, value)
BK (String, key) ==>  BOOK, BOAK, BKOA, OAKB, KOOB, BKOO (ArrayList, value)


Once the above Hashmap is constructued, it is trivial to implement the methods.
